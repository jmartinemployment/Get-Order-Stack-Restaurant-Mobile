# Restaurant Owner Interview Guide
## For: Dinner Conversation with In-Laws (Peruvian Fast Casual Restaurants)

---

## 🎯 Your Goal
Learn about their daily reality, frustrations, and wishes - NOT sell them on your software. Listen more than you talk. Take mental notes (or excuse yourself to the bathroom and type notes in your phone).

## Conversation Flow

### Opening (Natural, Not Salesy)
> "I've been working on a software project and realized I don't know enough about how restaurants actually work day-to-day. Would you mind if I asked you some questions about how you run things? I'm genuinely curious."

---

## Part 1: Daily Operations (10-15 minutes)

**The Day-in-the-Life Questions:**

1. "Walk me through yesterday. What time did you wake up? When did you get to the restaurant? What was the first thing you dealt with?"

2. "What's the most annoying part of opening the restaurant each day?"

3. "What about closing? What takes the longest?"

4. "When you're not at the restaurant, what are you still doing for the business?" (Looking for: spreadsheets at home, phone calls with staff, worrying)

**Listen for:**
- Tasks that sound repetitive or manual
- Frustration in their voice
- Things that "should be easy but aren't"

---

## Part 2: Technology & Tools (10-15 minutes)

**Current Stack Questions:**

5. "What system do you use for taking orders? How do you like it?"

6. "How much do you pay for it monthly?" (They might not know exactly - that's telling)

7. "If you could change one thing about it, what would it be?"

8. "What other software or apps do you use for the restaurant?" 
   - Accounting? (QuickBooks, Wave, shoebox of receipts?)
   - Scheduling? (Paper, text messages, app?)
   - Inventory? (Clipboard? Spreadsheet? Nothing?)
   - Online orders? (DoorDash? Own website? Phone calls?)

9. "Do you ever have issues when the internet goes down?" (Testing offline pain)

10. "Show me your phone - what restaurant apps do you have?" (This reveals a lot)

**Listen for:**
- Monthly costs they mention
- Workarounds they've created
- Things they do manually that software should handle

---

## Part 3: Pain Points & Money (10-15 minutes)

**The Money Questions:**

11. "What's the thing that keeps you up at night about the restaurant?"

12. "When's the last time something went wrong that cost you money? What happened?"

13. "How do you know if you had a good week? When do you find out?"

14. "What surprised you about food costs recently?"

15. "Have you ever run out of something during a busy night? What happened?"

**The Staff Questions:**

16. "How do you handle scheduling? Is it a headache?"

17. "How do you split tips among staff?"

18. "When you hire someone new, how long before they're useful?"

**Listen for:**
- Numbers (costs, losses, margins)
- Emotional weight in their answers
- Stories of specific disasters

---

## Part 4: Wishes & Priorities (5-10 minutes)

**The Dream Questions:**

19. "If you had a magic wand and could fix one thing about running the restaurant, what would it be?"

20. "What do you wish you knew in real-time that you currently find out too late?"

21. "Is there anything you pay for that you feel like you're not getting value from?"

22. "If I built something that could help with [whatever pain they mentioned], would you try it?"

---

## Part 5: Online Ordering Specific (5 minutes)

23. "How do customers order from you now? Phone? Walk-in? Apps?"

24. "Do you use DoorDash/UberEats/Grubhub? What percentage do they take?"

25. "Do you have a website? Can people order from it?"

26. "Would your customers order ahead for pickup if it was easy?"

---

## Closing

> "This was really helpful. I'm not trying to sell you anything tonight - I'm just learning. But as I build this thing, would you be open to trying it out and giving me feedback? You'd be helping me make it better for restaurants like yours."

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't pitch.** If you start explaining your software vision, you'll stop learning.

2. **Follow the emotion.** When they get animated (frustrated or excited), dig deeper: "Tell me more about that."

3. **Specifics > Generalities.** "What happened last time?" is better than "Does that happen often?"

4. **It's okay to not understand.** "I don't know what that means, can you explain?" shows respect and gets better answers.

5. **Spanish is fine.** If they switch to Spanish, let them. Have your spouse translate later if needed. Comfort = honesty.
